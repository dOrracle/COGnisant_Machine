Self‑Evolving Application Use Case
Purpose

Describe how to use COGnisant_Machine to build a self‑evolving AI application: an orchestrated system where templates, agent/tool pairings, and parameters evolve over time using telemetry-driven fitness signals while preserving safety and auditability.
Who this is for

Teams building adaptive pipelines: multi‑agent research workflows, automated ML/data pipelines, adaptive schema managers, trading strategy discovery, or any system that benefits from continuous automated improvement guided by metrics and governance.
Core concepts

Shadow Agents (manifests only): zero‑code agent definitions (cogIds + manifest) that bind to concrete implementations at runtime.
Wheels: small orchestrator instances that host sets of cogs and isolate experiments.
Evolution Engine: produces candidate variants (template parameter tweaks, prompt variants, agent/tool pairings) using mutation/crossover strategies.
Pattern Recognizer (Intelligence Layer): learns context → best combo mappings from usage history.
Fitness Calculator: multi‑objective scoring function combining correctness, cost, latency, reliability, user feedback.
Safe Promotion Pipeline: canary → evaluate → promote → audit; human gates for high‑risk actions.
Evidence Envelope & Grounding Service: normalized retrieval artifacts that agents must reference for provenance.
Minimal data contracts

Task Envelope (input to a wheel):
{ requestId, cogSelector, templateVersion, context, options }
Evidence Envelope:
[{ id, text, snippet, source, vectorScore, retrievalMethod, timestamp, metadata }]
Agent Result (output):
{ requestId, result, usedEvidenceIds, citations, confidence, metadata }
Lineage Event:
{ requestId, templateVersion, cogId, implId, evidenceIds, fitnessDelta, timestamp }
High‑level workflow

Client sends task envelope to Wheel.
Wheel resolves shadow agent (manifest) → chosen implementation binding.
Wheel calls GroundingService -> returns Evidence Envelope.
TemplateEngine renders prompt or schema with evidence injected.
Implementation executes with scoped capability tokens (tool calls routed through proxy).
Wheel validates output, records lineage, updates schema/usage history.
PatternRecognizer ingests usage; EvolutionEngine periodically generates and simulates candidate variants.
Candidates tested in sandbox/canary Wheels; successful candidates are promoted via registry (manifest alias update) after human or automated approval.
Fitness design (recommendation)

Multi-objective composite with configurable weights:
correctness / quality (human or automatic checks) — 40%
reliability / success rate — 20%
efficiency (latency / resource cost) — 15%
grounding usage / provenance fidelity — 15%
user satisfaction / feedback — 10%
Fitness must be explainable — provide logs and lineage for every delta.
Safety & governance

Default deny destructive actions: any template/state change that affects persistent stores requires allowDestructive flag + admin approval.
Sandbox all evolution experiments: run EvolutionEngine in a sandbox Wheel with simulated workloads where possible.
Human‑in‑the‑loop promotion: require review for permanent promotions of templates or agents that change behavior significantly or enable writes.
Policy engine checks at bind-time: manifest trustLevel and requiredApprovals gate tokens and write scopes.
Explainability: every promoted change should include reason (fitness improvement metrics) and a human-readable summary from XAI component.
Experimentation patterns

Parameter sweeps: vary template knobs (evidence count, temperature, truncation) — quick wins.
A/B flows: split traffic between versions, collect metrics, compare.
Simulated training: when real evaluation is expensive, run candidate against simulated or historical workloads (e.g., backtests for trading strategies).
Meta‑evolution: allow the EvolutionEngine to tune its own hyperparameters (mutation rates) but keep meta‑evolution behind strict approval.
Observability & metrics to capture

Per-request: requestId, cogId, implId, templateVersion, evidenceUsed, latency, success/failure, cost estimate
Per-candidate: fitness, parent lineage, acceptance rate in canary, rollout status
Global: number of promotions, rollback frequency, policy violations blocked
Alerts: unexpected fitness regressions, policy violations, spike in fallback/clarification prompts
Testing & CI

Contract tests for every implementation binding: run IO contract checks on registration.
Evolution smoke tests: run a candidate batch in sandbox and ensure no destructive or unsafe behaviors.
Canary evaluation pipeline: automated metric checks (statistical significance thresholds) + rollback criteria.
Replay tests: ability to replay evidence + template + impl to reproduce results.
Operational checklist (must-haves)

Evidence envelope mandatory and audited.
Scoped capability tokens and tool proxy in place.
Sandbox runs with resource limits and automatic kill policies.
Registry supports alias promotion & atomic rollback.
Lineage storage (graph or event store) for forensic and explainability queries.
Quick example: how to evolve a prompt parameter

Seed: template v1 (evidenceCount=3, temperature=0.7) — fitness baseline computed.
Mutate: generate candidates with evidenceCount ∈ {2, 3, 4}, temperature ∈ {0.6, 0.7, 0.8}.
Evaluate: run candidates in sandbox on historical tasks, compute fitness.
Promote: if candidate outperforms baseline by threshold and passes safety checks, promote to canary (route 5% traffic).
Monitor: if canary meets metrics over period, promote to stable; else rollback.
When NOT to auto‑evolve

Safety-critical contexts with zero tolerance for change (e.g., patient data modifications) — use manual tuning and human review only.
Cold-start domains w/o enough telemetry — seed with curated templates and avoid blind evolution until minimal data exists.
Recommended first experiments (30–90m)

Tune evidenceCount parameter for a thought‑mod: run candidate variants against a small test set, measure grounding usage and answer correctness.
Evolve prompt truncation strategy: compare top‑k vs. semantic‑filter evidence selection; measure quality & latency.
Small trading‑sim: evolve ATR thresholds and position sizing in a sandbox backtest to validate evolution mechanics and safety workflows.
